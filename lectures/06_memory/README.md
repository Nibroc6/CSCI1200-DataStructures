# Lecture 6 --- Pointer and Dynamic Memory

- Different types of memory
- Dynamic allocation of arrays

## 6.1 Three Types of Memory

- Stack memory: a region of a computer's memory that is used for the storage of local variables and function call information. When you create variables inside a function, such variables are called local variables and local variables will be stored on the stack and get deallocated when variables go out of scope. For example:

```cpp
void func() {
	int x;
	double y;
}
```

- Static memory: variables allocated statically (with the keyword static), located at the data segment of the program's memory. They are are not eliminated when they go out of scope. They retain their values throughout the entire program execution, but are only accessible within the scope where they are defined. For example:

```cpp
static int counter;
```

- Dynamic memory: explicitly allocated (on the heap) as needed. This is our focus for today.

## 6.2 Dynamic Memory

Dynamic memory is:
- created using the **new** operator,
- accessed through pointers, and
- removed through the **delete** operator.
 Here’s a simple example involving dynamic allocation of integers:

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>

 <pre>
int * p = new int;
*p = 17;
cout << *p << endl;
int * q;
q = new int;
*q = *p;
*p = 27;
cout << *p << " " << *q << endl;
int * temp = q;
q = p;
p = temp;
cout << *p << " " << *q << endl;
delete p;
delete q;
 </pre>

</td>
<td><img src="heap.png" alt="heap"</td>
</tr>
</table>

<!--![alt text](heap.png "heap")-->

- The expression *new int* asks the system for a new chunk of memory that is large enough to hold an integer
and returns the address of that memory. Therefore, the statement

```cpp
int * p = new int; 
```

allocates memory from the heap and stores its address in the pointer variable *p*.

- The statement

```cpp
delete p;
```

takes the integer memory pointed by *p* and returns it to the system for re-use.
- This memory is allocated from and returned to a special area of memory called the **heap**. By contrast, local
variables and function parameters are placed on the stack.
- In between the *new* and *delete* statements, the memory is treated just like memory for an ordinary variable,
except the only way to access it is through pointers. Hence, the manipulation of pointer variables and values is
similar to the examples covered in the pointers lecture except that there is no explicitly named variable for that memory
other than the pointer variable.
- Dynamic allocation of primitives like ints and doubles is not very interesting or significant. What’s more important is dynamic allocation of arrays and class objects.

- Play this [animation](https://jidongxiao.github.io/CSCI1200-DataStructures/animations/dynamic_memory/example1/index.html) to see what exactly the above code snippet does.

### 6.2.1 Exercise

What’s the output of the following code?

```cpp
double * p = new double;
*p = 35.1;
double * q = p;
cout << *p << " " << *q << endl;
p = new double;
*p = 27.1;
cout << *p << " " << *q << endl;
*q = 12.5;
cout << *p << " " << *q << endl;
delete p;
delete q;
```

### 6.2.2 Exercise

In the following program, which variable is stored on the stack?

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void func1() {
    int a = 42;
    std::cout << "a: " << a << std::endl;
}

void func2() {
    int* b = new int(42);
    std::cout << "b: " << *b << std::endl;
    delete b;
}

int c = 42;
static int d = 42;

int main() {
    func1();
    func2();

    std::cout << "c: " << c << std::endl;
    std::cout << "d: " << d << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## 6.3 Dynamic Allocation of Arrays
- How do we allocate an array on the stack? What is the code? What memory diagram is produced by the code?
- Declaring the size of an array at compile time doesn’t offer much flexibility. Instead we can dynamically allocate an array based on data. Here’s an example:

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>

 <pre>
int main() {
    std::cout << "Enter the size of the array: ";
    int n,i;
    std::cin >> n;
    double *a = new double[n];
    for (i=0; i &lt; n; ++i) { a[i] = sqrt(i); }
    for (i=0; i &lt; n; ++i) {
        if ( double(int(a[i])) == a[i] )
            std::cout << i << " is a perfect square " << std::endl;
    }
    delete [] a;
    return 0;
}
 </pre>

</td>
<td><img src="array.png" alt="array"</td>
</tr>
</table>

- The expression new double[n] asks the system to dynamically allocate enough consecutive memory to hold n
double’s (usually 8n bytes).
  - What’s crucially important is that n is a variable. Therefore, its value and, as a result, the size of the
array are not known until the program is executed and the the memory must be allocated dynamically.
  - The address of the start of the allocated memory is assigned to the pointer variable a.
- After this, a is treated as though it is an array. For example: a[i] = sqrt( i );
In fact, the expression a[i] is exactly equivalent to the pointer arithmetic and dereferencing expression *(a+i)
which we have seen several times before.
- After we are done using the array, the line: delete [] a; releases the memory allocated for the entire
array and calls the destructor for each slot of the array. Deleting a dynamically allocated array without the [] is an error (but it may not cause a crash or other noticeable problem, depending
on the type stored in the array and the specific compiler implementation).
- Since the program is ending, releasing the memory is not a major concern. However, to demonstrate that you understand memory allocation & deallocation, you should always delete dynamically allocated
memory in this course, even if the program is terminating.
- In more substantial programs it is ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL. If we forget to release memory repeatedly the program can be said to have a memory leak. Long-running programs with memory leaks will eventually
run out of memory and crash.

- Play this [animation](https://jidongxiao.github.io/CSCI1200-DataStructures/animations/dynamic_memory/example2/index.html) to see what exactly the above code snippet does.

## 6.4 Dynamic Allocation of Two-Dimensional Arrays

To store a grid of data, we will need to allocate a top level array of pointers to arrays of the data. For example:

```cpp
double** a = new double*[rows];
for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    a[i] = new double[cols];
    for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
        a[i][j] = double(i+1) / double (j+1);
    }
}
```
- Draw a picture of the resulting data structure.
- Then, write code to correctly delete all of this memory.

- Play this [animation](https://jidongxiao.github.io/CSCI1200-DataStructures/animations/dynamic_memory/two_d_array/index.html) to see what exactly the above code snippet does.

## 6.5 Dynamic Allocation: Arrays of Class Objects

We can dynamically allocate arrays of class objects. The default constructor (the constructor that takes no arguments) must be defined in order to allocate an array of objects.

```cpp
class Foo {
public:
  Foo();
  double value() const { return a*b; }
private:
  int a;
  double b;
};

Foo::Foo() {
    static int counter = 1;
    a = counter;
    b = 100.0;
    counter++;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    Foo *things = new Foo[n];
    std::cout << "size of int: " << sizeof(int) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "size of double: " << sizeof(double) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "size of foo object: " << sizeof(Foo) << std::endl;
    for (Foo* i = things; i < things+n; i++)
        std::cout << "Foo stored at: " << i << " has value " << i->value() << std::endl;
    delete [] things;
}
```

The above program will produce the following output:

```console
size of int: 4
size of double: 8
size of foo object: 16
Foo stored at: 0x104800890 has value 100
Foo stored at: 0x1048008a0 has value 200
Foo stored at: 0x1048008b0 has value 300
Foo stored at: 0x1048008c0 has value 400
...
```

## 6.6 Exercises

- [Leetcode problem 1480: Running Sum of 1d Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/). Solution: [p1480_runningsumofarray.cpp](../../leetcode/p1480_runningsumofarray.cpp)

## 6.7 Memory Debugging

In addition to the step-by-step debuggers like gdb, lldb, or the debugger in your IDE, we recommend using a memory
debugger like “Dr. Memory” (Windows, Linux, and MacOSX) or “Valgrind” (Linux and MacOSX). These tools can
detect the following problems:
- Use of uninitialized memory
- Reading/writing memory after it has been free’d (NOTE: delete calls free)
- Reading/writing off the end of malloc’d blocks (NOTE: new calls malloc)
- Reading/writing inappropriate areas on the stack
- Memory leaks - where pointers to malloc’d blocks are lost forever
- Mismatched use of malloc/new/new [] vs free/delete/delete []
- Overlapping src and dst pointers in memcpy() and related functions

## 6.8 Sample Buggy Program

Can you see the errors in this program?

```cpp
1 #include <iostream>
2
3 int main() {
4
5 int *p = new int;
6 if (*p != 10) std::cout << "hi" << std::endl;
7
8 int *a = new int[3];
9 a[3] = 12;
10 delete a;
11
12 }
```

## 6.9 Using Dr. Memory http://www.drmemory.org

Here’s how Dr. Memory reports the errors in the above program:

```console
~~Dr.M~~ Dr. Memory version 1.8.0
~~Dr.M~~
~~Dr.M~~ Error #1: UNINITIALIZED READ: reading 4 byte(s)

```

And the fixed version:

```console
~~Dr.M~~ Dr. Memory version 1.8.0
hi
~~Dr.M~~
~~Dr.M~~ NO ERRORS FOUND:
~~Dr.M~~ 0 unique, 0 total unaddressable access(es)

~~Dr.M~~ Details: /DrMemory-MacOS-1.8.0-8/drmemory/logs/DrMemory-a.out.7762.000/results.txt
```

**Note**: Dr. Memory on Windows with the Visual Studio compiler may not report a mismatched free() / delete
/ delete [] error (e.g., line 10 of the sample code above). This may happen if optimizations are enabled and the
objects stored in the array are simple and do not have their own dynamically-allocated memory that lead to their
own indirect memory leaks.

## 6.10 Using Valgrind http://valgrind.org/

And this is how Valgrind reports the same errors:

## 6.11 How to use a memory debugger

- Detailed instructions on installation & use of these tools are available here:
http://www.cs.rpi.edu/academics/courses/spring24/csci1200/memory_debugging.php
- Memory errors (uninitialized memory, out-of-bounds read/write, use after free) may cause seg faults, crashes,
or strange output.
- Memory leaks on the other hand will never cause incorrect output, but your program will be inefficient and
hog system resources. A program with a memory leak may waste so much memory it causes all programs on
the system to slow down significantly or it may crash the program or the whole operating system if the system
runs out of memory (this takes a while on modern computers with lots of RAM & harddrive space).
- For many future homeworks, Submitty will be configured to run your code with Dr. Memory or Valgrind to search for
memory problems and present the output with the submission results. For full credit your program must be
memory error and memory leak free!
- A program that seems to run perfectly fine on one computer may still have significant memory errors. Running
a memory debugger will help find issues that might break your homework on another computer or when
submitted to the homework server.
- **Important Note**: When these tools find a memory leak, they point to the line of code where this memory
was allocated. These tools does not understand the program logic and thus obviously cannot tell us where it
should have been deleted.
- A final note: STL and other 3rd party libraries are highly optimized and sometimes do sneaky but correct and
bug-free tricks for efficiency that confuse the memory debugger. For example, because the STL string class
uses its own allocator, there may be a warning about memory that is “still reachable” even though you’ve
deleted all your dynamically allocated memory. The memory debuggers have automatic suppressions for some
of these known “false positives”, so you will see this listed as a “suppressed leak”. So don’t worry if you see
those messages.

## 6.12 Diagramming Memory Exercises

- Draw a diagram of the heap and stack memory for each segment of code below. Use a “?” to indicate that the
value of the memory is uninitialized. Indicate whether there are any errors or memory leaks during execution
of this code.

```cpp
class Foo {
public:
  double x;
  int* y;
};
Foo a;
a.x = 3.14159;
Foo *b = new Foo;
(*b).y = new int[2];
Foo *c = b;
a.y = b->y;
c->y[1] = 7;
b = NULL;
```

See [solution](memory_exercise1_solution.png).

```cpp
int a[5] = { 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 };
int *b = a + 2;
*b = 7;
int *c = new int[3];
c[0] = b[0];
c[1] = b[1];
c = &(a[3]);
```

See [solution](memory_exercise2_solution.png). Note that there is a memory leak of 3 *int*s in this program. Do you see why?

- Write code to produce this diagram:
